# YZV311E - Data Mining Project: Predictive Analytics for E-commerce Replenishment

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for a major e-commerce platform to enhance customer experience by anticipating their replenishment needs. By analyzing customer purchasing behavior, we aim to predict when essential items will be needed again, allowing the platform to provide timely and relevant product recommendations.

## Proposal
For a detailed description of the project objectives, dataset, candidate models, and our evaluation plan, please refer to the [Project Proposal](./Proposal.md).

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is provided through a Kaggle competition and includes transaction records reflecting customer purchasing patterns. [Access the dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/yzv311e_term_project_fall_24_25/data)

## Methodology
We will explore a range of machine learning models, including:
- **Logistic Regression and Decision Trees**: For baseline performance.
- **Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)**: To capture complex relationships.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: For sequential pattern recognition, suited for time-dependent purchase prediction.

## Evaluation
Our models will be evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**

Cross-validation will be used to ensure robustness and mitigate overfitting.

## Team
- **Umut Çalıkkasap**: Focused on data preprocessing, literature review, and exploratory analysis.
- **Pınar Erçin**: Handling model development, tuning, and evaluation.

## Timeline
- **October 29**: Proposal submission
- **December 30**: Kaggle competition final submission
- **January 6**: Code submission on Ninova
- **January 12**: Final report submission
